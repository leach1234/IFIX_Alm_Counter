# IFIX_Alm_Counter


This takes in .ALM files generate by IFIX 5.5 (might work with other versions), and converts them into a CSV file contain tag, and alarm, as well as number occurance (note it does a occurance for generated, as well as cleared).

Copy the .ALM file(s) into the same dirctory as this, and it will generate a .csv file per .ALM file.

This does have centain limitation, i.e. not checking for comms failures, but works as a crude tool for alarm counting, and procesing alarms down.
